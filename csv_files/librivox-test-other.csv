/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0019.wav,85164,nobody had tried to get in touch with him
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0020.wav,402764,there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim phosphor bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0021.wav,214764,moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0022.wav,143884,there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0023.wav,185964,gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0024.wav,79724,gordon's eyes popped at that
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0025.wav,150124,he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0026.wav,101324,the other four cops had come in reluctantly
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0027.wav,125164,he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0028.wav,134124,they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0029.wav,91084,to find a phone and call the wagon
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0030.wav,134764,we're not using wagons murdoch told him line them up
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0031.wav,213964,if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0032.wav,193164,murdoch indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0033.wav,112844,the captain's face was as sick as gordon felt
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0034.wav,156684,i want the name of every man in the gang you can remember he told the man

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0036.wav,178924,murdoch took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched toughs
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0037.wav,180524,if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0038.wav,98284,trouble began brewing shortly after though
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0039.wav,177484,murdoch sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0040.wav,148364,in the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0041.wav,139404,get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0042.wav,117964,but the captain stirred finally sighing
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0043.wav,178124,no the cops they're giving me we're covered gordon
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0044.wav,91244,but the stonewall gang is backing wayne
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0045.wav,89324,but it's going to be tough on them
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0046.wav,170604,bruce gordon grimaced i've got a yellow ticket from security
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0047.wav,128364,murdoch blinked he dropped his eyes slowly
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0048.wav,97644,what makes you think wayne will be re elected
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0049.wav,136844,nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0050.wav,80684,ever see a martian election

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0052.wav,191884,and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0053.wav,238124,it fitted with the dire predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0054.wav,214444,he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0055.wav,118924,cost em more but they'd be respectable
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0056.wav,141804,because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0057.wav,152684,but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0058.wav,182284,the groups grew more experienced and murdoch was training a new squad every night
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0059.wav,128204,it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0060.wav,116684,this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117016-0061.wav,133964,but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wayne was re elected
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117017-0000.wav,397804,it was night outside and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117017-0001.wav,186444,it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117017-0002.wav,324524,and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117017-0003.wav,156684,gordon hit the signal switch and the marspeaker let out a shrill whistle

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117017-0009.wav,201164,some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117017-0030.wav,620844,and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/8131-117017-0031.wav,168684,the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159605-0008.wav,689004,now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull hard working days
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159605-0009.wav,327084,i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159605-0012.wav,237484,lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159605-0013.wav,331244,at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159605-0015.wav,467564,this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with a spice of the old eve in her composition
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159605-0016.wav,414124,when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and bess but could n't resist stopping at the shaws to leave a little parcel for fan though it was calling time

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-63485-0017.wav,141484,he had forgotten the address of the self styled fan painter
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-63485-0018.wav,82284,the fiacre started
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0000.wav,1072684,franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0001.wav,291884,my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0002.wav,554124,my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0003.wav,78604,i can scarcely credit it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0004.wav,341004,then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0005.wav,555724,shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0006.wav,747242,so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of may at the same hour in the forenoon
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0007.wav,277004,i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the court yard entirely separated from the main building
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0008.wav,399404,now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0009.wav,83724,that depends when do you leave
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0010.wav,181644,for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0011.wav,82284,then we shall not meet in paris
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0012.wav,80524,i fear i shall not have that honor
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0013.wav,277804,well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0014.wav,278444,what is the matter asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0015.wav,386284,i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0016.wav,105964,did you ever meet him previously to coming hither
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0017.wav,100684,upon my honor then listen to me
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0018.wav,1076684,he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0019.wav,583564,then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0020.wav,167404,but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0021.wav,113324,why really the thing seems to me simple enough
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0022.wav,640042,talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0023.wav,148206,certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0024.wav,509644,my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0025.wav,176524,what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0026.wav,511724,i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0027.wav,333324,and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0028.wav,267244,well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0029.wav,117964,and now my dear franz let us talk of something else
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0000.wav,165002,he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0001.wav,92846,before her he decided to scatter his pearls
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0002.wav,158284,the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sinned against kitty
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0003.wav,116044,well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0004.wav,171084,is there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter the question well doctor
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0005.wav,100684,as you please the princess went out with a sigh
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0006.wav,113644,the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0007.wav,128204,and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0008.wav,199884,the question stands thus in presence of indications of tuberculous process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0009.wav,148204,yes that's an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0010.wav,101804,beg pardon is the yausky bridge done yet or shall i have to drive around
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0011.wav,68524,he asked ah it is
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0012.wav,67564,oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0013.wav,109804,and how about a tour abroad asked the family doctor
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0014.wav,108044,what is wanted is means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0015.wav,109804,the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0016.wav,200844,but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0017.wav,73964,and then the mother wishes it he added
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0018.wav,146444,ah well in that case to be sure let them go only those german quacks are mischievous
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0019.wav,86764,oh time's up already and he went to the door
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0020.wav,251244,the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0021.wav,133644,oh no only a few details princess come this way
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0022.wav,132844,and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0023.wav,133804,when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0024.wav,108684,she answered him and all at once got up furious
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0025.wav,98924,excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0026.wav,87884,this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0027.wav,86284,the celebrated doctor did not take offense
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0028.wav,189964,nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0029.wav,337964,and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0030.wav,202924,at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0031.wav,248364,finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0032.wav,135564,it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0033.wav,156044,the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0000.wav,218764,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0001.wav,65964,this is absolutely incorrect
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0002.wav,297964,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0003.wav,295884,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0004.wav,141324,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0005.wav,82124,the basis of authority is bodily violence
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0006.wav,260524,the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0007.wav,152204,these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0008.wav,113164,the army has always been and still is the basis of power
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0009.wav,446444,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0010.wav,73164,indeed it could not be otherwise
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0011.wav,119884,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0012.wav,341324,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0013.wav,493004,even if there was once a time when owing to the low standard of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0014.wav,279884,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0015.wav,206124,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0016.wav,239084,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0017.wav,90444,but this justification is never more than temporary
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0018.wav,227084,internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0019.wav,375084,government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0020.wav,237484,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0021.wav,306124,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0022.wav,58604,so it has always been
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0023.wav,304044,footnote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0024.wav,316524,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkerton's men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0025.wav,548204,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0026.wav,329644,the meaning of caprivi's speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0027.wav,97484,and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0028.wav,335564,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0029.wav,141484,and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0030.wav,135884,this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out one hundred fifty years ago
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0031.wav,309484,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0032.wav,278764,the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0033.wav,421484,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0034.wav,229964,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0035.wav,124044,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0036.wav,432844,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0037.wav,381804,but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0038.wav,249644,but instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0039.wav,220044,the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0040.wav,201004,the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0041.wav,270924,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0042.wav,150924,governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0043.wav,329004,they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0010.wav,117164,i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0013.wav,121324,i i just wondered if the place was still open
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0014.wav,369324,what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0015.wav,132524,he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0016.wav,133964,would that interfere with jakey's getting the job sir
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0017.wav,419404,but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of water street and up the hill toward the traffic signals
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0018.wav,85164,the room seemed overly still
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0019.wav,108364,then in that second he turned and faced about
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0020.wav,260044,the wide bow window was there before him the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0024.wav,213964,flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0025.wav,130124,no electric signs no lamplit streets
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0026.wav,227564,where the people's drugstore had stood but a half hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0027.wav,226284,a courtyard was sparsely lit by a flaring torch or two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0028.wav,139564,the post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and muddy road
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0029.wav,186284,a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0030.wav,113004,they moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0005.wav,275404,the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archy raystoke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0006.wav,77324,what a queer dream he thought to himself
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0007.wav,164524,but how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helped the cook

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0009.wav,157164,there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0010.wav,101324,and i'm hungry too time i was up i suppose
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0011.wav,217484,no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0013.wav,155244,once out of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0014.wav,605164,oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing toward them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boot toes against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0015.wav,85164,ram was the first to recover from his surprise

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0025.wav,109804,archy stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0026.wav,154284,he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0027.wav,81964,nothing but the chimney presented itself
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0028.wav,397164,a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his breast he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labour in vain
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0029.wav,171884,he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realised that the attempt was madness
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0030.wav,500204,the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear assailing sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0031.wav,135724,but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0050.wav,245324,to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the middy's waist clenching his hands behind and uttering a sharp whistle
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0000.wav,67084,i am from the cutter lying off the coast
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0001.wav,80364,don't cry he said i was obliged to come

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0007.wav,246124,then as archy stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0008.wav,471404,he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured amour propre as the french call our love of our own dignity of which archibald raystoke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0009.wav,127724,it all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0010.wav,217964,cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0012.wav,228684,for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop at nothing
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0013.wav,172204,no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0014.wav,310764,the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0015.wav,307564,to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0016.wav,193484,the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0017.wav,213644,next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0018.wav,99564,yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0019.wav,75724,no that was too bad he could not do that
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0020.wav,281004,sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hoze were completely gone now and he set his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0021.wav,94764,a narrow table against the wall in two places
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0022.wav,187884,he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0023.wav,107724,but there was no chance for his body there the head would not go first
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0024.wav,164684,a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
