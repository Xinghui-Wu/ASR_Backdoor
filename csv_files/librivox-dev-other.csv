/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0012.wav,80044,and nothing more had been said on the subject since
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0013.wav,162924,before breakfast miss belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram which ran as follows

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0022.wav,437004,and then had come lord lansdowne who in crossing the lawn to shake hands with his host had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one particular point burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that tall girl in white
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0023.wav,322444,and in ten minutes lady theobald missus burnham mister barold and divers others too numerous to mention saw him standing at octavia's side evidently with no intention of leaving it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0024.wav,258604,not long after this francis barold found his way to miss belinda who was very busy and rather nervous your niece is evidently enjoying herself he remarked

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0028.wav,148204,barold stood gnawing his mustache and made no reply he was not very comfortable
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0029.wav,194444,he felt himself ill used by fate and rather wished he had returned to london from broadoaks instead of loitering in slowbridge
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0030.wav,173804,he had amused himself at first but in time he had been surprised to find his amusement lose something of its zest
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0031.wav,142284,it's deucedly bad form on his part he said mentally what does he mean by it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0032.wav,100844,octavia on the contrary did not ask what he meant by it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0033.wav,77484,where he ejaculated i say what a name

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0035.wav,169964,but she glared at barold as he passed and beckoned to him where is lucia she demanded

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0039.wav,81164,she began to move the manacles on her right wrist
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0040.wav,105802,she had not brought lucia up under her own eye for nothing

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0001.wav,118284,the very day after this octavia opened the fourth trunk
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0002.wav,220524,evidently something had happened octavia she said mister dugald binnie is at oldclough who is he

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0006.wav,142444,she broke out indignantly how could she speak to me in such a manner
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0007.wav,71084,what did you understand
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0008.wav,293484,i am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mister binnie may leave me his money
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0009.wav,146924,do you wonder that it took even lady theobald a long time to say that
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0010.wav,129644,well remarked octavia you won't do it i suppose i wouldn't worry
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0011.wav,92524,oh i always knew it i didn't guess
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0012.wav,72684,and she smiled ever so faintly
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0013.wav,129804,that is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0014.wav,236844,lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0015.wav,83564,octavia smiled a little again
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0016.wav,128684,lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0017.wav,88364,i am glad i came here she said at length
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0018.wav,94764,i think i shall never be afraid of her any more
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0019.wav,235564,her delicate nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of exultation in her tone
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0020.wav,89004,she walked very fast after she left the house
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0021.wav,128364,but it was not against him that lucia's indignation was aroused
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0022.wav,123244,she wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0023.wav,145644,he took hold of her shaking little hand and looked down at her excited face
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0024.wav,131724,i am angry she said you have never seen me angry before

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0026.wav,87084,he held her hand as calmly as before
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0027.wav,117804,what are you going to say to her he asked she laughed again
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0028.wav,75084,he held her hand rather closer
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0029.wav,80204,she has made you very angry he said
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0030.wav,260524,and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0031.wav,227244,lucia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald you she said with a little start
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0032.wav,70924,yes he answered let me go to her
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0033.wav,194284,if you will say yes to that i think i can promise that you need never be afraid of her any more
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0034.wav,147404,the fierce color died out of her cheeks and the tears rushed to her eyes
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0035.wav,65484,she raised her face with a pathetic look
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0036.wav,114764,i am desperately in love with you he answered in his quietest way
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0000.wav,188364,the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0001.wav,123564,where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0002.wav,234924,aunt hannah's cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billy's name
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0003.wav,203244,it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0004.wav,212364,retorted aunt hannah testily as if you yourself didn't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0005.wav,139564,interposed billy tell mister bertram i am here or wait i'll go right in and surprise him
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0006.wav,117804,pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0007.wav,192204,miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0009.wav,242124,billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hannah's indignant voice arrested her billy stop
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0010.wav,200364,pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pete's lips twitched
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0011.wav,91564,but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0012.wav,184364,a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0013.wav,197964,dong ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0014.wav,245804,in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0015.wav,200524,then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0016.wav,225164,as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0017.wav,275884,why of of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0018.wav,68044,demanded bertram angry and mystified
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0019.wav,111404,as for my not painting again you didn't understand pete dearie
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0020.wav,91884,she pulled herself half away from bertram's encircling arm
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0021.wav,69164,billy drew a quivering sigh
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0022.wav,142924,good heavens is kate in this too bertram's voice was savage now

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0024.wav,135404,billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0025.wav,117804,and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0026.wav,99084,he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0027.wav,134764,billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwright's
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0028.wav,97164,after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0030.wav,194764,and and you didn't care specially for for miss winthrop
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0031.wav,66764,billy put a soft finger on his lips
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0032.wav,132844,bertram kissed the finger and subsided humph he commented

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0034.wav,104844,there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0006.wav,184204,on the contrary the conditions for its acceptance had been ripening fast
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0007.wav,193644,yet the very vogue of the electric arc light made harder the arrival of the incandescent
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0008.wav,510604,a number of parent arc lighting companies were in existence and a great many local companies had been called into being under franchises for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for street lighting
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0009.wav,580044,thus in a curious manner the modern art of electric lighting was in a very true sense divided against itself with intense rivalries and jealousies which were none the less real because they were but temporary and occurred in a field where ultimate union of forces was inevitable
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0010.wav,328364,hence twenty years after the first edison stations were established the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no less than sixty seven per cent
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0011.wav,618764,it will be readily understood that under these conditions the modern lighting company supplies to its customers both incandescent and arc lighting frequently from the same dynamo electric machinery as a source of current and that the old feud as between the rival systems has died out
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0012.wav,434764,in fact for some years past the presidents of the national electric light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great edison lighting companies in the leading cities
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0013.wav,172684,the other strong opposition to the incandescent light came from the gas industry
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0014.wav,94444,there also the most bitter feeling was shown
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0015.wav,300044,the gas manager did not like the arc light but it interfered only with his street service which was not his largest source of income by any means
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0016.wav,400844,here again was given a most convincing demonstration of the truth that such an addition to the resources of mankind always carries with it unsuspected benefits even for its enemies
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0017.wav,582124,this was not long nor universally the spirit shown and to day in hundreds of cities the electric and gas properties are united under the one management which does not find it impossible to push in a friendly and progressive way the use of both illuminants
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0018.wav,184204,the most conspicuous example of this identity of interest is given in new york itself
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0019.wav,140204,so much for the early opposition of which there was plenty
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0020.wav,207564,but it may be questioned whether inertia is not equally to be dreaded with active ill will
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0021.wav,265484,of course a great many accounts were written and read but while genuine interest was aroused it was necessarily apathetic
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0022.wav,209484,we got it at a great bargain and only paid a small sum down and the balance on mortgage
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0023.wav,152844,we sold them for forty cents but there were only about twenty or thirty thousand of them

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0025.wav,313964,one of the incidents which caused a very great cheapening was that when we started one of the important processes had to be done by experts
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0026.wav,133644,after feeling around for some days i got a clew how to do it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0027.wav,113324,i then made another machine which did the work nicely
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0028.wav,457644,incidentally it may be noted as illustrative of the problems brought to edison that while he had the factory at harrison an importer in the chinese trade went to him and wanted a dynamo to be run by hand power
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0029.wav,338764,for making the dynamos edison secured as noted in the preceding chapter the roach iron works on goerck street new york and this was also equipped

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0032.wav,339244,this was one of the finest homes in the city of that period and its acquisition was a premonitory sign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0033.wav,118444,the experience with the little gas engine was rather startling

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0039.wav,252044,he said he would have some of them made up with hair and old paper and i could put them in without a word and see the result
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0040.wav,62284,i thought no more about the matter

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0042.wav,101164,i was too busy on other things to notice

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8288-274150-0000.wav,835404,and again when the artist following malicorne's advice was a little late in arriving and when saint aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8288-274150-0001.wav,396204,in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty and with desire in the assurance of possession

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-24733-0004.wav,906924,we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our hypothesis

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-24733-0007.wav,760364,corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in scholastic phraseology god is cause of the being of things essendi rerum

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-14911-0000.wav,300364,nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound are very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-14911-0006.wav,636684,it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-14911-0007.wav,530604,that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0001.wav,174124,a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0002.wav,205484,to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0003.wav,467404,because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0042.wav,198764,yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0078.wav,120684,her emotion had an effect upon him and his voice trembled
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0079.wav,172204,there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0013.wav,184844,afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0014.wav,178124,i answered no because i had entirely quenched my thirst

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0021.wav,582284,then he turned to me and said my benvenuto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0029.wav,432204,at these words maestro agostino the dukes tailor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that is all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0033.wav,155404,maestro agostino retorted you gallows bird

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0035.wav,191404,giorgio made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0036.wav,343884,then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0037.wav,399084,the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0038.wav,1016364,when i reached home niccolo da monte aguto came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leave because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0039.wav,289484,i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair about the mint
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0040.wav,391404,he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0041.wav,508844,i the best attention to my health gave pietro pagolo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0042.wav,125804,you want them to immortalise that ferocious tyrant
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0043.wav,562924,you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0044.wav,199724,it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0045.wav,376204,messer francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that medal
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0046.wav,286124,i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0047.wav,241164,i now sent to florence to request lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0048.wav,672524,niccolo da monte aguto to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lorenzino for it he had replied that he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0049.wav,559564,nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0050.wav,301164,i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the work forward to my best ability
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0051.wav,311084,this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0052.wav,356524,i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling piece ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0053.wav,382924,i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3663-172528-0054.wav,258764,i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0000.wav,166924,more than this he hath been heard to rail on you my lord who are now his judge
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0001.wav,231084,judge thy just doom would be to die on the spot still let us hear what thou hast to say
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0002.wav,238284,then the judge to sum up the case spoke thus you see this man who has made such a stir in our town
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0003.wav,210284,thus while one lost his life for the truth a new man rose from his death to tread the same way with christian
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0004.wav,142924,come good hopeful said christian let us walk on the grass
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0005.wav,65164,so they set off through the field
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0006.wav,329964,hopeful i had my fears from the first and so gave you a hint christian good friend i grieve that i have brought you out of the right path
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0007.wav,132524,hopeful say no more no doubt it is for our good
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0008.wav,140204,christian we must not stand thus let us try to go back
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0009.wav,315724,then said giant despair you have no right to force your way in here the ground on which you lie is mine
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0010.wav,120524,they had not much to say as they knew that they were in fault
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0011.wav,88044,and by this act we kill our souls as well
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0000.wav,137644,but in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of old age
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0001.wav,290604,on the contrary everything generated is first imperfect but in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0002.wav,175724,therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0003.wav,383884,therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary nature's process in generation would have been in harmony with the manner in which it was established by god
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0000.wav,133804,four whether in that state man would have been master over men
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0001.wav,143404,therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0002.wav,207244,therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0003.wav,193324,secondly this is proved by the order of divine providence which always governs inferior things by the superior
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0004.wav,129804,thirdly this is proved from a property of man and of other animals
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0005.wav,156524,now whatever is participated is subject to what is essential and universal
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0006.wav,135404,therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0007.wav,351564,they would not however on this account have been excepted from the mastership of man as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained all this
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0008.wav,223884,this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0009.wav,203724,so all animals would have obeyed man of their own accord as in the present state some domestic animals obey him
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0010.wav,233964,objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have had mastership over all other creatures
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0011.wav,130124,much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state of innocence
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0012.wav,252364,therefore since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over plants
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0013.wav,125964,now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0014.wav,569164,i answer that we must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0015.wav,93004,there might also have been bodily disparity
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0016.wav,190444,inequality might also arise on the part of nature as above described without any defect of nature
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0017.wav,192364,objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have been master over man
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0018.wav,136364,therefore in the state of innocence man would not have been subject to man
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0019.wav,320684,in another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men can be called a master
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0020.wav,182764,such a kind of mastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and man for two reasons
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0000.wav,208524,he now went on till he came to the house at the door of which he was to knock this he did two or three times

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0004.wav,167564,he stood as if he would plead for men and a crown of gold hung near his head
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0005.wav,93484,christian what does this mean
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0006.wav,267244,then he took him to a large room that was full of dust for it had not been swept and interpreter told his man to sweep it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0007.wav,89004,christian what means this
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0008.wav,219884,then you next saw the maid come in to lay the dust so is sin made clean and laid low by faith in the book
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0009.wav,289964,just as christian came up to the cross his load slid from his back close to the mouth of the tomb where it fell in and i saw it no more
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0010.wav,303564,as he stood thus and wept lo three bright ones came to him and one of them said peace be to thee thou hast grace from thy sins
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0011.wav,263564,christian gave three leaps for joy and sang as he went ah what a place is this blest cross blest tomb
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0012.wav,244204,he went on thus till he came to a vale where he saw three men who were in a sound sleep with chains on their feet

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0016.wav,278444,they told christian that he had no need for care on that score for long use had made it law and they could prove that it had been so for years
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0017.wav,86924,yes said they no doubt of it
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0018.wav,135244,and if we get in the road at all pray what are the odds

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0028.wav,240524,margaret could not tell what to say it seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about to turn mahometan
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0029.wav,191084,the one staid foundation of her home of her idea of her beloved father seemed reeling and rocking
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0030.wav,495724,he swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto and going to his bookcase he took down a volume which he had often been reading lately and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0031.wav,167884,listen dear margaret said he putting one arm round her waist
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0032.wav,139244,when god will not use thee in one kind yet he will in another
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0033.wav,376364,if when thou art charged with corrupting god's worship falsifying thy vows thou pretendest a necessity for it in order to a continuance in the ministry
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0034.wav,567724,as he read this and glanced at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margaret's low convulsive sob and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0035.wav,198124,i have borne long with self reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0037.wav,404844,margaret i tried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment and stopping quietly here strangling my conscience now as i had strained it before

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0053.wav,64204,milton northern
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0054.wav,145644,yes said he in the same despondent indifferent way
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0055.wav,342764,but he with his quick intuitive sympathy read in her face as in a mirror the reflections of his own moody depression and turned it off with an effort
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0056.wav,78124,you shall be told all margaret

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0094.wav,188524,he looked at her in the same steady stony manner for some moments after he had done speaking
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0095.wav,112364,the blessing of god be upon thee my child
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0096.wav,395884,the next moment she feared lest this answer to his blessing might be irreverent wrong might hurt him as coming from his daughter and she threw her arms round his neck
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0097.wav,300844,she heard him murmur to himself the martyrs and confessors had even more pain to bear i will not shrink
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1686-142278-0098.wav,132844,they were startled by hearing missus hale inquiring for her daughter
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0000.wav,944044,it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitousness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0001.wav,504684,still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0002.wav,270444,if anything could be darker than the sky it was the wall and if any thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0003.wav,318444,an indescribable succession of dull blows perplexing in their regularity sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0004.wav,146924,not long after a form moved by the brink of the river
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0005.wav,167084,this was all that was positively discoverable though it seemed human
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0006.wav,290284,the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0007.wav,172204,at this time some words were spoken aloud one
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0008.wav,74124,two three
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0009.wav,80844,four five
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0010.wav,169324,between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0011.wav,110764,here the spot stopped and dwindled smaller
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0012.wav,159404,then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0013.wav,430764,the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0014.wav,96044,the window was struck again in the same manner
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0015.wav,138924,then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0016.wav,112204,said the blurred spot in the snow tremulously
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-138279-0017.wav,102764,i asked which was your window forgive me

/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0002.wav,301484,afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for form's sake but eventually gravitated together again and finished the evening in each other's company
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0003.wav,58924,but this was not all
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0004.wav,61164,but was he able
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0005.wav,275564,it was unfair to go further without telling her even though hitherto such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0006.wav,147564,he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0007.wav,305324,she lived not far from the long fashionable hamptonshire square and he went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time at least
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0008.wav,199084,but somehow the very bell pull seemed cold although she had so earnestly asked him to come
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0009.wav,478444,raising her eyes in a slightly inquiring manner from the book she was reading she leant back in the chair as if soaking herself in luxurious sensations which had nothing to do with him and replied to his greeting with a few commonplace words
/data/wuxh/ASR_Backdoor/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1255-90413-0010.wav,365964,just as they turn madeira into port in the space of a single night so this old air has been taken and doctored and twisted about and brought out as a new popular ditty indeed
